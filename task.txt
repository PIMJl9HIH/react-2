Hi Roman,
Please, find the test task below.

Project description
Your app gets a json as in sdks.json (attached), and populate it into a view like the following mockup. You don't need to implement http fetching, just develop around sdks.json as it is.

1. The view has 2 separate panels: filter panel on the left and filtered results on the right. Each panel is scrollable.
2. There're 3 kinds of filters on the left panel: 
(a) search filter, when chosen, only results with title containing search terms will be shown. Results are updated on every key stroke.
(b) "all", when chosen, all results are shown
(c) tags, aggregated from sdks.json and sorted alphabetically, when chosen, only sdks with that tag are shown in results
3. Filters are exclusive, select one will deselect the others
4. Each result item comes with a title and a group of tags. They are displayed in the right panel in alphabetic order. 

Requirements 
1. Basic documentation 
2. Use React 16.4 
3. Use a CSS preprocessing language 
4. Big plus is testing with Jest and Enzyme 
5. It must be written in ES6 
6. It must be a npm project, (webpack) 

Waiting for your you test done

Good luck!
